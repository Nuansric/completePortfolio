                    <h1 class="centered">About Me</h1>

                    <p>I am a true full stack web developer who is very passionate about both front-end and back-end development because both beauty, design, creativity, endless problem solving and learning new things motivate me. As far as front-end development
                        goes, I am experienced in using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS as well as ReactJS. I am also experienced using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Bridge as I am working to get the Adobe certifications in May, 2017. For
                        back-end development, I have worked with both javaScript and C#. However, if I have to choose between the two, I more experience with javaScript. I have experiences in using server-side javaScript, NodeJS and Express. Databases
                        like mySQL, MongoDB and Firebase are the ones that I am very familiar with. Throughout the course of web development, I have worked with many major APIs like Yelp, Edamam, Twitter, Spotify, Google and Twillo Authentication API.
                    </p>

                    <p>As far as education, work and hobby go, I graduated magna cum laude from college in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry (Pre-medicine). After 6 months of medical internship, I realized the long and unpredictable schedules
                        of healthcare personal is not something I want to endure for the rest of my life. So, I have been managing my family business since junior year of college while looking for the new passion. I have a lot of free time from work,
                        and I have been using it with my hobby. On the side, I am an artist who love creativity, like to draw and paint. I also do home and business interior design and decoration as a side business. Since I love both science and art,
                        I looked into computer programming and I feel very fortunate programming also shares many things that I love with the science and art such as logic, formulas and creativity.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since, I am both a scientist, entrepreneur as well as artist, I looked in to computer programming as my new career goal because this field has many things that I enjoy and more. It allows me to be technical and creative at the same
                        time. I have acquired many transferrable skills from previous experiences like management, chemistry, artistic and design. I am very easy to work with because I am very motivated and passionate about most of things I do, and once
                        I set my mind to something, I will try my best to see it through to completion. I am a hard worker and somewhat of a perfectionist because I believe in trying and doing my very best in everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>From managing a business, I learned to work well with challenge and complications, and I have no problem working under pressure. Business management is something that I enjoy throughly, however, I think it is time that I step out of
                        the comfort zone and do something more challenging on my own; it is time that I learn to work in a new environment of larger settings. I am hoping to grow and learn in web development as I become more and more familiarized with
                        the industry. I eventually hope be able to use my skills to help others who are in need.
                    </p>
